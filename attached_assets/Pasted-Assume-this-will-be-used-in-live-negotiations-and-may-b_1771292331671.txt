Implement Prompt 1 ONLY: Engine hardening + Scenario Driver Explanations.
Keep diffs minimal. Do not refactor unrelated files. Keep all tests passing.

FILES ALLOWED TO CHANGE
- src/lib/analysis/scenarioEconomics.ts
- src/lib/calculations/CONVENTIONS.md
- src/lib/__tests__/terminationFeeEngine.test.ts (adjust if needed)
- src/lib/scenario-engine.ts (only if needed to access base vs scenario)
- src/lib/analysis/tenantStrategy.ts or src/lib/analysis/dealSheetSummary.ts (only if needed for display-ready driver output type)
- Add at most 1 new pure helper file under src/lib/analysis/ (optional)

GOALS (Do in this order)

A) Make unamortized balance convention airtight
1) In CONVENTIONS.md, explicitly define unamortized balance at monthIndex as the balance BEFORE that month’s payment.
2) In scenarioEconomics.ts, update the unamortized helper to follow this convention consistently:
   - If amort schedule rows provide beginning_balance, use it.
   - Else compute: totalToAmortize - sum(principal for months < monthIndex).
   - monthIndex 0 must equal totalToAmortize.
   - Clamp within [0, totalToAmortize].
3) Update termination componentsAtMonth to use this unamortized value.

B) Scenario Driver Explanations (Top 3)
Add a pure function that compares two MonthlyEconomics objects (base vs scenario) and returns the top 3 drivers by absolute impact on TOTAL net cash flow (sum of monthlyCashflow.net_cash_flow), grouped into:
- Base Rent (contractual_base_rent)
- Free Rent / Abatement (abatement_credit)
- Operating (operating)
- Parking (parking)
- Amortized (amortized_costs)
- One-time Costs (ti_shortfall + transaction_costs)
- Other Recurring (other_recurring)

Return shape example:
{ label: string; delta: number; note?: string }
with delta signed (scenario - base).

Integrate these driver summaries into the scenario comparison result object so the UI can display them later WITHOUT UI changes. (If scenario-engine.ts is the right place, attach drivers to the scenario comparison output.)

TESTS
- Tighten/adjust terminationFeeEngine.test.ts expectations to the new unamortized convention (avoid loose tolerances).
- Add a small new test for driver ranking (pure function) using two synthetic MonthlyEconomics stubs or by generating base+scenario from existing fixtures.

Run all tests and report changed files + what was added.
