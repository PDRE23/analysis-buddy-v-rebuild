Assume this will be used in live negotiations and may be shown to a client, landlord, lender, or attorney. Any ambiguity or incorrect math is unacceptable.

Implement Prompt 2 ONLY: UI upgrades.
Keep diffs minimal. Do not restyle the app. Use existing components. Keep all tests passing.

FILES ALLOWED TO CHANGE
- src/components/analysis/ProposalTab.tsx (preferred)
- src/components/analysis/AnalysisTab.tsx (if the annual table lives here)
- src/components/analysis/Workspace.tsx (only if needed to pass props)
- src/components/analysis/ScenarioComparisonTable.tsx (or whatever renders scenario comparisons)
- Add at most 1 new small component: src/components/analysis/TerminationPanel.tsx (optional)

GOALS (Do in this order)

1) Make annual rollup the default client view
- Wherever the annual cashflow table is rendered, use:
  result.monthlyEconomics?.annualFromMonthly ?? result.cashflow
- Do NOT remove legacy cashflow. This is display-only.

2) Add a Termination section with a month slider (client-facing)
- Add a “Termination” panel (ProposalTab preferred) that:
  a) Determines termMonths from monthlyEconomics.monthlyCashflow.length
  b) Default selected month:
     - 36 if termMonths > 36 else Math.floor(termMonths/2)
  c) Slider bounds:
     - min = 0 (or 12 if you choose; if you choose 12, explain in comments)
     - max = termMonths - 1
  d) On change, calls termination.componentsAtMonth(monthIndex) and displays:
     - thenCurrentRent
     - penaltyRent
     - unamortized
     - totalFee
     - eqMonths
  e) Also display penaltyMonths and a single headline number for totalFee
- If no termination modeled, show a simple empty state (“No termination option modeled.”)
- Optional (lightweight): show a tiny table for fees at Month 12 / 24 / 36 / 60 / end (only those that exist). No new chart libs.

3) Display Scenario Driver Explanations in scenario comparison UI
- In scenario comparison table/list, for each non-base scenario:
  - Render top 3 drivers as bullets:
    “+/- $X: <Label>”
  - Use the drivers returned by analyzeScenarios() (e.g., entry.drivers.topDrivers).
- Keep it compact and readable. No new styling framework.

VALIDATION
- No runtime errors in the app.
- Tests pass.

OUTPUT
- List files changed
- Tell me exactly where in the UI to click to see the termination slider + driver bullets.
