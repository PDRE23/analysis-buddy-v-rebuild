Assume this will be used in live negotiations and may be shown to a client, landlord, lender, or attorney. Any ambiguity is unacceptable.

Goal: Upgrade the Annual Table and Lease Terms Summary to be client-ready, using monthlyEconomics as the source of truth. Keep diffs minimal. Do not refactor unrelated code. No math changes. Keep all tests passing.

FILES ALLOWED TO CHANGE
- src/components/analysis/AnalysisTab.tsx
- src/components/analysis/YearTable.tsx (if this is the annual table)
- src/components/analysis/KPI.tsx (only if needed for formatting)
- src/components/analysis/Workspace.tsx (only if needed for prop wiring)
- src/components/analysis/LeaseTermsSummary.tsx (if exists) OR add 1 new component:
  src/components/analysis/LeaseTermsSummary.tsx

TASKS

A) Annual table polish (display only)
1) Ensure the annual table uses:
   annual = monthlyEconomics?.annualFromMonthly ?? cashflow
2) Table rows should be, in this order:
   - Base Rent
   - Operating
   - Parking
   - Other Recurring
   - Subtotal
   - Abatement (Free Rent)
   - TI Shortfall
   - Transaction Costs
   - Amortized Costs
   - Net Cash Flow
3) Add:
   - Total column or Total row (sum across years)
   - Per RSF row for: Subtotal and Net Cash Flow (divide by RSF, handle RSF=0 safely)
4) Formatting:
   - Currency formatting consistent with existing helpers (no new formatting utilities)
   - Negative values display with minus sign and parentheses if existing style supports it
5) Do not change calculation logic, only how it is displayed.

B) Lease Terms Summary panel (client-facing)
1) Add a “Lease Terms Summary” card above or beside the annual table in AnalysisTab.
2) Populate fields from AnalysisMeta + normalized dates/term where available, plus monthlyEconomics assumptions:
   Required fields:
   - RSF
   - Commencement, Expiration
   - Term (months and years)
   - Lease Type (FS/NNN)
   - Base Year (if applicable)
   - Starting Rent PSF (first rent_schedule rent_psf)
   - Rent escalation summary (fixed percent / fixed amount / custom)
   - Abatement summary (type, free months, applies_to)
   - TI allowance PSF and total
   - TI shortfall total (if any)
   - Transaction costs total (if any)
   - Parking summary if present (stalls, monthly rate, escalation)
   - Discount rate used for NPV
3) Keep it compact, two-column grid of label/value pairs. No new styling system.

C) Verification
- Run all tests.
- Ensure no TypeScript/LSP errors.
- Confirm UI renders with no runtime errors.

Output: list files changed and where the Lease Terms Summary appears.
